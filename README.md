### **Project Overview:**

This project aims to develop a web application that visually represents the orbits of near-Earth objects (NEOs) in real-time. The app, inspired by the Orrery, a mechanical model of the Solar System, will provide users with a comprehensive understanding of NEO trajectories and potential risks.

### **Problem Statement:**
* Create a web app that displays the near-Earth objects.

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   * Utilize NASA's Open API to retrieve real-time data on NEOs, including their positions, velocities, and potential impact risks.
   * Store the acquired data in a suitable format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for efficient processing.

2. **Data Processing:**
   * Clean and normalize the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   * Calculate the orbits of NEOs based on their position and velocity data.
   * Implement algorithms to determine potential impact probabilities and estimated impact dates.

3. **Web App Development:**
   * Choose a suitable frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) for building the web app's user interface.
   * Design a visually appealing and intuitive interface that allows users to explore NEO orbits and information.
   * Implement interactive features such as zooming, panning, and filtering to enhance user experience.
   * Integrate the processed NEO data into the web app to display orbits, impact probabilities, and other relevant information.

### **Technical Stack:**

* **Frontend:** [Frontend Framework] (e.g., React, Angular, Vue)
* **Backend:** [Backend Technology] (e.g., Node.js, Python)
* **Database:** [Database System] (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
* **API:** NASA's Open API
* **Libraries/Tools:** [Relevant libraries and tools] (e.g., D3.js for visualizations, Chart.js for charts)

### **Features:**
* **Real-time NEO visualization:** Display the orbits of NEOs in 3D space.
* **Interactive exploration:** Allow users to zoom, pan, and rotate the view.
* **Information display:** Provide details about individual NEOs, including their size, distance from Earth, and potential impact risks.
* **Impact probability:** Calculate and display the probability of a NEO impacting Earth.
* **Estimated impact dates:** Show potential impact dates for NEOs.
* **Filtering and search:** Enable users to filter NEOs based on various criteria (e.g., size, distance).

### **Deployment:**
* Deploy the web app to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS) for easy accessibility.

### **Future Enhancements:**
* **Integration with astronomical data:** Incorporate data from other astronomical sources to provide more context for NEO observations.
* **Machine learning models:** Develop machine learning models to predict NEO trajectories and potential impacts with greater accuracy.
* **User customization:** Allow users to customize the appearance and behavior of the web app.
